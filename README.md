# 🎮 Movie Recommender System

A comprehensive and intuitive Movie Recommender System that harnesses the power of **Machine Learning**, **Python**, and **Flask** on the backend, paired with a responsive **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** frontend to deliver a seamless user experience. This project demonstrates the implementation of multiple recommendation strategies, including content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid approaches.

## 🔍 Overview

This application allows users to receive personalized movie recommendations by selecting a movie title. The system supports:

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Calculates the similarity between movies based on metadata such as genre, cast, crew, and plot descriptions using natural language processing and cosine similarity.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes user ratings to recommend movies that similar users have enjoyed, implemented using the `Surprise` library with matrix factorization techniques like SVD.
- **Hybrid Filtering**: Integrates both content and collaborative filtering to enhance the accuracy and relevance of recommendations by combining their output. The final recommendation list is generated by merging scores from both techniques and prioritizing overlapping results.

## 🤨 Machine Learning Pipeline

- **Data Preprocessing**: Leveraged `pandas` to clean and merge multiple movie-related datasets.
- **Feature Extraction**: Created a composite textual feature using genre, keywords, cast, and director.
- **Text Vectorization**: Applied `CountVectorizer` from `scikit-learn` to transform text features into token counts.
- **Similarity Computation**: Utilized **Cosine Similarity** for content-based similarity scoring.
- **Collaborative Model**: Built a user-item matrix and implemented collaborative filtering using `Surprise` with SVD.
- **Model Storage**: Serialized models, similarity matrices, and title mappings using `joblib` for efficient retrieval.

## 📁 Directory Structure

Currently, the models and processed folders are empty. However they will be populated with the required files after main.py is executed.

## 📚 Future Enhancements

- Improve hybrid filtering logic by adding weight tunability
- Using Real-time datasets to incorporate newly released movies too.
- Displaying data such as movie poster, director, cast and a brief plot summary with the recommendations on the frontend.
- Allowing registration of new users and storing their data in the database.
- Making it possible for users to rate certain movies and then saving the data dynamically for future recommendations.

## ⚠️ Limitations

While the system performs well in many cases, there are several known limitations:

- **Cold Start Problem**: Struggles with recommending movies for new users or newly added movies without sufficient data.
- **Data Sparsity**: User-item rating matrix is sparse, affecting the performance of collaborative filtering.
- **Scalability**: Currently tested on a moderate dataset; larger datasets may require optimization or use of more scalable infrastructure.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Model retraining is offline; new ratings or user behavior aren’t reflected until models are retrained.
- **Metadata Dependency**: Content-based filtering heavily relies on accurate and comprehensive metadata (genres, cast, etc.).
